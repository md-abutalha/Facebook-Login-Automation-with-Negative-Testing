# Facebook-Login-Automation-with-Negative-Testing
echo "# Facebook Login Page Automation

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the login functionality of Facebookâ€™s web page, emphasizing negative test cases to assess the robustness of the login process against various invalid inputs.

## Project Details
Using Selenium WebDriver with Java, this project tests the login page against multiple negative test scenarios, including:
- Invalid email formats
- Empty email and/or password fields
- Special characters in email and password fields
- Excessively long input values

## Features
- **Automated Tests**: Selenium WebDriver automates user interactions on the Facebook login page.
- **Error Verification**: Asserts and verifies error messages appear as expected for invalid inputs.
- **Allure Reports Integration**: Test results are integrated with Allure for detailed and visual reporting.

## Technology Stack
- **Java**: Programming language used for writing test scripts.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Automates browser interactions.
- **TestNG**: Test framework to structure and execute tests.
- **Allure Reports**: Provides an enhanced view of the testing reports.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    \`\`\`
    git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/md-abutalha/Facebook-Login-Automation-with-Negative-Testing.git)>
    \`\`\`
2. Import the project into your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Ensure dependencies are installed ( Selenium WebDriver, TestNG).
4. To generate reports, add Allure plugin to the environment.

## Usage
- Run tests by executing TestNG test files or running the projectâ€™s main suite.
- After test execution, view Allure reports to analyze the test results.

## Test Cases
Detailed test cases, focusing on negative scenarios, are available in the `testcases` folder:
1. Invalid email formats
2. Empty fields
3. Long strings
4. Special character handling

## Example
Here's an example of how negative tests were handled for invalid inputs to ensure error messages are displayed as expected.
